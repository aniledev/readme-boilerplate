## About This Project

In this project, I created a FIFO (First In First Out) pet adoption service using a queue data structure. This full stack application has a custom built RESTful API using Express and allows for CRUD actions. It is powered by a queue data structure and JavaScript.

## Built With

This full stack pet adoption application relies on :

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [RESTful API](https://github.com/aniledev/petful-server)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Queue data strucutre](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/)

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Upcoming Features

- User can create multiple lists
- User can leave comments and reviews based on a book
- User can share the books through social media
